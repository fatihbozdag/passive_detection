# Passive Detection Progress

## Objectives
1. Annotate the ICLE concordance dataset with PassivePy
2. Annotate the same dataset with our custom implementation
3. Compare the results between the two approaches
4. Analyze differences in detection patterns

## Script Explanations

### 1. `my_passive_detector.py`
This script contains our custom implementation for passive voice detection. It uses a combination of:
- Advanced regex patterns for identifying different passive constructions
- SpaCy's dependency parsing for structural analysis
- Special case handling for commonly missed passives (e.g., election-related, negated passives)
- Enhanced filtering to reduce false positives

### 2. `run_passive_detector.py`
This script provides the interface for running PassivePy on text data. It handles:
- Text preprocessing
- Passive phrase detection and extraction
- Results formatting and display

### 3. `compare_implementations.py`
This script compares the results of PassivePy and our custom implementation:
- Loads test datasets
- Processes the data with both implementations
- Calculates agreement metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, Cohen's Kappa)
- Analyzes disagreements between the implementations
- Generates visualizations

### 4. `analyze_icle_concordance.py`
This script processes the ICLE concordance dataset with our custom implementation:
- Merges Left, Center, and Right columns to create complete sentences
- Analyzes sentences with our custom passive detector
- Extracts detailed passive voice patterns and statistics
- Generates visualizations of the results
- Saves annotated data and statistics to files

## Steps

- [x] Annotate the ICLE concordance dataset with custom implementation
- [ ] ~~Annotate the ICLE concordance dataset with PassivePy~~ (Unable to properly import PassivePy)

### 3. Comparison Analysis
- [x] Calculate agreement statistics (Cohen's Kappa) on crowd source data
- [x] Identify patterns in disagreements
- [x] Generate visualizations of comparison results

## Recent Improvements
1. Enhanced detection of election-related passives ("was elected", "was chosen")
2. Better identification of by-agent passives across different tenses
3. Improved handling of negated passives ("isn't considered", "wasn't seen")
4. Added special handling for "left + participle" constructions
5. Better handling of simple subject-verb passives ("Sports are played")
6. More sophisticated filtering of adjectival states to reduce false positives

## ICLE Analysis Results
- 10,000 sentences from the ICLE concordance dataset were analyzed
- 9,796 sentences (98.0%) contain passive voice constructions
- Average of 3.16 passive phrases per sentence
- 1,192 sentences (12.2% of passive sentences) contain by-agents
- The most common passive pattern types are dependency-parsed passives, followed by perfect passives
- Chinese-Mandarin, Other, and Russian language groups show the highest rate of passive use
- Dutch, Chinese-Cantonese, and Portuguese speakers also show high passive usage rates

## Current Status
Our custom implementation achieves the same F1-score as PassivePy (0.85) on the crowd source dataset, with better recall (0.84 vs 0.77). The ICLE concordance dataset has been fully analyzed with our custom implementation, revealing interesting patterns in passive voice usage across different native language groups. Full results are available in the generated CSV files and visualizations.
